- 👋 Hi, I’m @AlyssumJ-83C5CD
- 👀 I’m interested in blending my love for design, art and illustration with my love for coding
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to create mobile-friendly or mobile apps from scratch
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on writing and data collecting apps and responsive websites
- 📫 How to reach me is through here... I guess because I don't want to give out my personal info. yet
- 😄 Pronouns: she, her
- ⚡ Fun fact: my mother is a web developer and programmer, so I have always been familiar with this field, but about 10 years ago, I found front-end development and fell in love
